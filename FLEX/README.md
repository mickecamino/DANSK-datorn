# Flex Operating System for DANSK-datorn
## Highly modified FLEX
DANSK-datorn uses a highly modified FLEX. I found the source code for it in the FLEX Archive BB166.DSK.  
The disk image contain the following files.   
File listings are as follow:  
```
DC4-BUG1.TXT
DC4-BUG2.TXT
DC4-BUG.TXT
FLEX-PO.SYS
FLEX-PO.TXT
```

FLEX-PO.SYS is the assembled code, ready to run on a DANSK-computer.  
FLEX-PO-TXT is the source code.  
DC4-BUG.TXT, DC4-BUG1.TXT and DC4-BUG2.TXT are also source code for the DANSK-computer.
